# WeatherApp
A weather application that tells the users the current weather live in their city (limited to Ontario for scope of project).

This app will use a GUI interface for users to interact with. The data will be provided via a real-time API that constantly updates the weekly weather per city.

For our API, we will be using https://openweathermap.org/ to help support our real-time weather data. We will be using requests to extract data from the API in order to update our weather app. This data will refresh hourly. For graphical data, we will be using Pandas to show users the weekly weather forecast with numbers. Our Icons will also be used from https://openweathermap.org/ for simplicity. 

This GUI interface uses the tkinter module.
